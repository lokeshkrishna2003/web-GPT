npm create vite@latest client(app name) --template vanilla (for creating a app with vanilla js )
select vanilla frame work with javascript variant 
dive into client app by cd client
then download the dependencies 
npm i 

now for the server side we are using node.js 

for this close the client side and create server folder 
npm init -y (for creating entry point from index.js with package.json file )
now install the necessary dependencies like cors(cross origin request shedule) express nodemon openai
npm install cors dotenv express nodemon openai



----> we have to keep the .env file always inside the server folder
